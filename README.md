# my-CRUD-politician
The objective of this app is to provide users with an engagement platform where they can submit reviews of their aldermen. By focusing on aldermen, we aim to augment local awareness of Chicago politics. 

Home- Interactive Ward map that routes users to their respective aldermen's profile. This page also contains the user login.

Profile- Aldermen profile page automatically generates object information: Name, Image, Email, Phone Number, Address, Object{review: String(body), Username: String, Date: String, Rating: Number} and also features the total number of reviews and an averaged composite score for that alderman.

Technologies used - HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, D3.js, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and deployed via Heroku.

In the future, we'd like to add a google maps overlay to the home page map so that users can zoom in and get a better perspective of their ward location. In addition, we're hoping to create a user profile page that will be filled with their posted reviews and limit the edit and delete functionality to that specific user/reviewer.
